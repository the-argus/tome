# tome

a file format specification for D&amp;D 5e classes, items, creatures, NPCs, and
player character sheets

## goals of tome

My goals in creating the tome file format are as follows (in order of
importance):

1. Make a barebones, easily editable representation of character sheets. I can't
deal with editing PDFs or using dndbeyond any longer.

2. Keep information about a player character's class in the same place as their
character.

3. Allow players to see where stats come from. A +5 to attack may be +1 racial
bonus, +2 proficiency, and +2 from a feature. A standard character sheet
doesn't show that breakdown.
